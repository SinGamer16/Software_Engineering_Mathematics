# Lecture Notes

## Overview
These are university-level lecture notes designed for software engineering students. Each topic includes conceptual explanations and practice problems.

## Topics Covered
- Asymptotic notation (O, Ω, Θ)
- Worst-case vs average-case analysis
- Recurrence relations (Master Theorem)
- Amortized analysis
- Time vs space tradeoffs
