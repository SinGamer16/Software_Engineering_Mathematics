# Lecture Notes

## Overview
These are university-level lecture notes designed for software engineering students. Each topic includes conceptual explanations and practice problems.

## Topics Covered
- Propositional logic
- Predicate logic
- Truth tables
- Logical equivalence
- Normal forms (CNF, DNF)
- Proof techniques: direct proof, proof by contradiction, proof by contrapositive, mathematical induction
