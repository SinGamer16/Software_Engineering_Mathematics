# Discrete Mathematics

Welcome to the Discrete Mathematics section. This foundational topic covers essential concepts that form the basis of computer science and software engineering.

## Topics Covered

- **[Set Theory](Set_Theory/README.md)**: Understanding sets, relations, and functions
- **[Logic](Logic/README.md)**: Propositional and predicate logic, proof techniques
- **[Functions](Functions/README.md)**: Function properties, composition, and inverses
- **[Counting and Combinatorics](Counting_and_Combinatorics/README.md)**: Permutations, combinations, and counting principles

!!! tip "Why Discrete Mathematics?"
    Discrete mathematics provides the mathematical foundation for algorithms, data structures, cryptography, and many other areas of computer science.

!!! note "Prerequisites"
    Basic algebra and mathematical reasoning skills are recommended before starting this section.
